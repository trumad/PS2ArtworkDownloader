# PS2ArtworkDownloader
A script to help download:

* Playstation 2 game covers
* Playstation 2 game disc art
* Playstation 2 game screenshots 
* Playstation 2 game background shots 

The image filenames are compatible with Open Playstation 2 Loader. With this, you'll be able to make a full collection of PS2 covers and have them show up on the OpenPS2 Loader menu. You can also choose specific games from a list and download all the artwork for only those games.

# Guide

1. Install Tampermonkey extension in Chrome or Firefox
2. Install the .js file from this repository as a tampermonkey script
3. Ensure tampermonkey settings > Downloads > Download Mode says "Browser API".
4. Visit http://oplmanager.no-ip.info/site/?gamelist.
5. Follow the instructions on the page

# Note

A full collection of the artwork in a single zip file as of November 2018 is available on https://archive.org/details/PS2Art2018 and probably has most of the games you need despite being a little out of date. That will be less time consuming than using this tool to download the artwork.
